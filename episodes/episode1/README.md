## What is CMake and `makefile` ?

- CMake makes your makefile

- Example of a `makefile` (just runs shell):

```makefile
default:
	cc main.c
```

- `CMakeLists.txt`

## The `cmake` Command

- Running `cmake` will consult the `CMakeLists.txt`.
- `-S [path-to-source]`
- `-B [path-to-build]`
- Example: `cmake -S src -B out/build`. The `src/` directory must have its own `CMakeLists.txt` file.

## Building

- Running a build will build (you don't touch these because it's generated by CMake. Just edit `CMakeLists.txt`):
- `CMakeFiles/` directory
- `cmake_install.cmake`
- `CMakeCache.tt`
- `Makefile`

## CMakeLists.txt

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10.2) // the minimum version of CMake required to run this CMake

project(learn_cmake) // name my project "learn_cmake"

// ${PROJECT_NAME} converts to "learn_cmake" as defined by the `project()` function
// the second argument "src/main.c" is the executable we want to build. After building with `cmake`, we can run `make` inside of `build/` to build an executable.
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} src/main.c). The executable will be named ${PROJECT_NAME} which we have specified in the add_executable() function, but can be changed otherwise
```
